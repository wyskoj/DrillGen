= DrillGen

DrillGen is designed to generate marching band drills at varying levels of difficulty. Its results are seen in the book _Haslett Viking Marching Band Master Handbook_.

This repository contains the source code for the library that generates drills. I've turned this into an app you can download from the Play Store.
